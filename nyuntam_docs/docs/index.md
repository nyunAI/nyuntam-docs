# Nyuntam

## Overview

**Nyuntam** is NyunAI's advanced suite designed to optimize, adapt, and accelerate a wide array of deep learning models across various domains. The repository is structured into several submodules, each targeting specific tasks:

- **[NYUNTAM TEXT GENERATION](./nyuntam_text_generation/index.md)**: Focuses on compressing large language models for text generation tasks.
- **[NYUNTAM VISION](./nyuntam_vision/index.md)**: Tailored for compressing and optimizing vision models.
- **[NYUNTAM ADAPT](./nyuntam_adapt/index.md)**: A robust module for fine-tuning and transfer learning across both vision and language models, leveraging state-of-the-art PEFT, full fine-tuning, and GPU parallelism.

## Setup and Installation

For hassle-free experimentation and quick results, Nyuntam provides a Command Line Interface tool: [nyunzero-cli](https://github.com/nyunAI/nyunzero-cli). The documentation for using the CLI can be found [here](./nyunzero_cli.md).

Nyuntam is a fully open-source project, and users are encouraged to explore the code and contribute to [Nyuntam](https://github.com/nyunAI/nyuntam).

## About NyunAI

NyunAI began its journey in 2020 with state-of-the-art research on model compression. Recognizing the challenges in setting up pipelines for model compression and downstream task adaptation, NyunAI aimed to simplify the process for researchers and developers, allowing them to efficiently build and deploy models while focusing entirely on problem-solving. Since then, NyunAI has remained committed to developing efficient deep learning technology and supporting software.
